          We concentrate on the building envelope: the roof, the walls, the
          windows, the underground and all the connections in between. We help
          create a design that is simple and cost effective but high
          performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the enclosure works together with the rest of the building, we
          work collaboratively with the rest of the project team to create a
          design that works for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thatâ€™s easy to construct, energy efficient, good for the
          environment, and most importantly: healthy, low-maintenance and
          comfortable for the occupants.
